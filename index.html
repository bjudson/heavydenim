</h3>
<p>
  Obscuress, the duo of Christina Carter and Spencer Dobbs, is a daedal blend of
  veiled minimalism, auditory porti√®re, and vested text.
</p>
<p>
  Christina Carter, a founding member of Charalambides, is known for her
  improvisational vocals and guitar work, which have been central to her solo
  career and numerous collaborations. Her music often explores themes of
  solitude, spirituality, and emotional sonority, incorporating elements of
  poetry and visual art.
</p>
<p>
  Spencer Dobbs' eremitic work in song has been described as "beautiful, deep,
  desperate, drunken late-in-the-night folk music." His releases are collected
  under the Texas Archives imprint.
